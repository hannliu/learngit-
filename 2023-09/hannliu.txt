I learned a lot through your website! Thank you so much for the helpful tips and your kindness!
I am currently learning Java, and our profs recommended to learn Git first. Thus, I chose to follow your website, and learned a lot.
I think the best thing of your tutorial is that you told us the principles behind each function. That is really useful for me, when deciding what to use and memorizing how to use the functions.
Thank you once again, and hopefully you could benefit more and more people.
Have a great rest of your day!

Best,
Hannah
